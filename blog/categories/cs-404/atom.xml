    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I reflect on <em>Ghost in the Wires</em>, the memoir of famous hacker Kevin Mitnick, I&rsquo;m disgusted by Mitnick&rsquo;s selfish disregard for others. Mitnick&rsquo;s thesis is that his hacks amounted to harmless games and that he was the victim of unjust persecution by brutish thugs from big corporations and the government. Mitnick never physically harmed anybody and never profited from his hacks, but his actions seriously wounded civil society&rsquo;s trust.</p>

<p>If we all had to deal regularly with liars like Kevin Mitnick, it would rock the foundations of society. Many social constructs are built on a foundation of trust, and they continue to stand, because most people are trustworthy. Liars that abuse that trust do real harm to those constructs. If everybody lied like Kevin Mitnick, sociality would become dangerous, and the joy of human interaction would be lost. Life would be miserable.</p>

<p>Kevin Mitnick now leads an honorable life, but the idea promoted in his memoir—that hacking and lying are a fun game for those cut out for it—is a dangerous attitude.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Exposing teenagers to computer science leads, not uncommonly, to a love affair with programming. Unfortunately, due to cultural influences, girls are far less likely to be exposed to programming by their peers. Computer science should be introduced to every junior high school student. Ensuring so would particularly benefit girls, who are less likely to discover the joy of programming outside of school.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Open source software is born, evolved, and maintained in the same way the whole economy of Zion will be. Open source development will work just as well for book authoring, scientific research, city planning, art, and many other disciplines as it does for software development. We&rsquo;ll benefit enormously if leaders in other fields adopt open source development like the software community has.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To grant companies, ISPs, or the government the power to censor Internet content undermines the principles that made the Internet great and threatens to diminish the Internet&rsquo;s power for good. The unregulated internet we are accustomed to won out over another vision for the World Wide Web: a tightly controlled, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/05/01/180255276/the-single-most-valuable-document-in-the-history-of-the-world-wide-web">&ldquo;government-sponsored broadband network that would have delivered video from TV stations and other approved content&rdquo;</a>—another FCC-regulated medium like radio or television. Such an internet might have been useless for pirating copyrighted material, distributing pornography, or bullying teenagers, but neither would it have facilitated an Arab Spring or inspired a generation of entrepreneurs. The properties of the World Wide Web that make it so dangerous are the same properties that make it a tool for incredible good. To control the Internet is to cripple it.</p>
