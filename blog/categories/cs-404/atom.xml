    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Exposing teenagers to computer programming leads, not uncommonly, to a love affair with programming. Unfortunately, due to cultural influences, girls are far less likely to be exposed to programming by their peers. Programming should be introduced to every junior high school student. Ensuring so would particularly benefit girls, who are less likely to discover the joy of programming outside of school.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Open source software is born, evolved, and maintained in the same way the whole economy of Zion will be. Open source development will work just as well for book authoring, scientific research, city planning, art, and many other disciplines as it does for software development. We&rsquo;ll benefit enormously if leaders in other fields adopt open source development like the software community has.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To grant companies, ISPs, or the government the power to censor Internet content undermines the principles that made the Internet great and threatens to diminish the Internet&rsquo;s power for good. The unregulated internet we are accustomed to won out over another vision for the World Wide Web: a tightly controlled, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/05/01/180255276/the-single-most-valuable-document-in-the-history-of-the-world-wide-web">&ldquo;government-sponsored broadband network that would have delivered video from TV stations and other approved content&rdquo;</a>â€”another FCC-regulated medium like radio or television. Such an internet might have been useless for pirating copyrighted material, distributing pornography, or bullying teenagers, but neither would it have facilitated an Arab Spring or inspired a generation of entrepreneurs. The properties of the World Wide Web that make it so dangerous are the same properties that make it a tool for incredible good. To control the Internet is to cripple it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thirty years ago, it was already clear to network managers like Clifford Stoll that the username/password method of authentication is faulty. (People tend to pick easy-to-remember passwords that are easy to guess; complex assigned passwords get written down and are easily stolen.) Given that so many other aspects of computing have evolved dramatically after all these years, it&rsquo;s remarkable that this model is the still the norm.</p>

<p>Because our authentication methods are the same as they were 30 years ago, many of Clifford Stoll&rsquo;s hacker&rsquo;s break-in tactics work just as well against today&rsquo;s networks as they did in the 80s. At least our intolerance for this kind of hacking has caught up with the risks! Such an intrusion would not be taken so lightly by today&rsquo;s network managers as it was by those Stoll elicited for support.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Republican lawmakers remind me of the conniving young mother who sought to persuade wise King Solomon that she was the actual mother of the disputed infant, but who shrugged at the proposed bisection of the tot. Democratic and Republican congresspeople argue with equal vigor that the other party is responsible for the shutdown, but out of the other side of their mouths, Republicans mutter <em>it&rsquo;s not even that bad</em>, betraying their guilt. If Republicans truly believed that President Obama and the Democrats caused the shutdown, they wouldn&rsquo;t try to downplay its gravity.</p>
